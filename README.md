-----------------------------------

Running MongoDB
========================

You need to install MongoDB on your computer before you can connect to it.

You can install MongoDB by following these instructions [Install MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation)

Once you have completed the installation process, try typing `mongo --version` into your command line.

Now you can start MongoDB on your computer with the `mongod` command.

Running node js server
========================

1. Open a terminal window (Mac) or a command window (Windows), and navigate (cd) to the server directory.

2. Install the server dependencies:

### `npm install`

3. Start the server: 

### `npm run start`



Open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) to view it in the browser.<br>

If you get an error, make sure you don't have another server listening on port 5000.<br>
